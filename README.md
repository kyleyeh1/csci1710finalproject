README
You should write a one-page README.md file describing how you structured your model and what your model proved. You can assume that anyone reading it will be familiar with your project proposal, but comprehensive documentation is always welcome. Here are some examples of points you might cover:

What tradeoffs did you make in choosing your representation? What else did you try that didnâ€™t work as well?


What assumptions did you make about scope? What are the limits of your model?


Did your goals change at all from your proposal? Did you realize anything you planned was unrealistic, or that anything you thought was unrealistic was doable?


How should we understand an instance of your model and what your visualization shows (whether custom or default)?
